# PawPedia - Dog Breed Directory

PawPedia is a comprehensive dog breed directory powered by AI, providing detailed information about various dog breeds.

## Features

- Detailed breed information generated by AI
- Beautiful photo galleries for each breed
- Responsive design for all devices
- Performance optimization with 6-month caching of AI-generated content

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Supabase account (for caching AI-generated content)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pawpedia.git
   cd pawpedia
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory
   - Add the following variables:
     ```
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
     NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
     ```

### Supabase Setup for Caching

1. Create a new Supabase project
2. Get your Supabase URL and anon key from the project settings
3. Set up the database table for caching:
   - Go to the SQL Editor in your Supabase dashboard
   - Run the SQL script from `supabase/migrations/20240701000000_create_breed_cache_table.sql`
   - This creates a `breed_cache` table with the necessary structure

## How the Caching System Works

PawPedia uses a caching system to improve performance and reduce API calls to the Gemini AI service:

1. When a user visits a dog breed page, the system first checks if there's a valid cache entry in Supabase
2. If a valid cache exists (not expired), the data is retrieved from Supabase
3. If no valid cache exists, the system calls the Gemini AI API to generate the breed information
4. The generated information is then stored in Supabase with a 6-month expiration
5. Subsequent visits to the same breed page will use the cached data until it expires

This approach significantly improves performance and reduces costs associated with AI API calls.

## Development

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## Deployment

### Vercel Deployment

The easiest way to deploy PawPedia is using Vercel:

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and sign up or log in
3. Click "New Project" and import your GitHub repository
4. Configure the project:
   - Set the Framework Preset to "Next.js"
   - Add the environment variables from your `.env.local` file
5. Click "Deploy"

Vercel will automatically build and deploy your application. Each time you push changes to your repository, Vercel will automatically redeploy your application.

### Manual Deployment

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Start the production server:

```bash
npm start
```
